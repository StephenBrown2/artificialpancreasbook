# Disclaimer

It probably goes without saying, but it’s always worth noting as you dive into this book or any of its content: I’m not a medical doctor. I’m a person with diabetes who’s been living with it for 16\(+\) years. I’ve helped to build & encourage adoption of DIY and other kinds of APS technology. I’ve used it myself now for more than 4 years. I’m biased. And I’m human.

The technology & approaches discussed in this book may not be approved by a regulatory body in your country. However, whether you’re considering DIY or other APS technology, or any approach to managing your diabetes: I hope you’ll evaluate it carefully and decide what works for you. Talk with your doctor or healthcare team if you’re considering making any changes.

Also, your diabetes will vary. It will vary from mine and everyone else’s. When you read stories, advice, or suggestions, either in a book or on the Internet or elsewhere - please remember that. What works for one person may not work for you, and that’s ok!
