# Acknowledgements

I wouldn’t be where I am today without my parents. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for teaching me to go to the concession stand... and spending several decades telling me to write a book.

I also wouldn’t be writing this book without Scott. On our fourth date, we went roller skating. He went to go pull his roller blades out of his trunk, and I asked him why he had a Costco-sized pack of juice boxes in his trunk. “Oh,” he said. “I know you said you treat your low BGs with juice boxes and I thought it would be helpful to keep some in my car for you in case you need them while we’re out and about.” He clearly got it. He got it faster than anyone I’ve ever met. And he kept asking questions, leading us to realize that teaching him was the same way we could “teach” or instruct a computer to do more heavy lifting in diabetes. And along the way, we fell in love, and he’s been with me ever since. Thank you, Scott, for never going “poof” and for so many reasons it would take an entire book to list... but especially being the first round editor of all my writing, including this book!

OpenAPS would not have happened, either, without years of work by Ben West. Thank you, Ben, not only for your years of work on pump communications, and hours spent working with Scott and I on various elements of what became OpenAPS, but also for being an excellent mentor and introducer to open source methodology.

The broader scaling of OpenAPS wouldn’t have happened, either, without many of the early adopters of OpenAPS, and all the work they did and continued on to do over the years in various projects in the DIY diabetes community. Continued thanks and hats off to Nate Rackleyft, Pete Schwamb, Chris Hanneman, Mark Wilson, Oskar Pearson, Kevin Lee, John Costik, Jason Calabrese, Sulka Haro, and many, many more.

In an open source community project like OpenAPS, especially ones that grows into a larger community movement, there are hundreds of contributors. People write code, file issues, report bugs, help troubleshoot, document new setups, develop new hardware or software, test things, answer questions,. share their stories, donate their data, and so much more. All of this work is incredibly valuable to the entire community.

**Thank you to everyone who has touched, and given so much to, the diabetes community through DIY & open source projects.**

And specifically for this book, many thanks to Tim Gunn for front cover design; to Aaron Kowalski for the foreword; as well as to those who provided early feedback and input into the book: Jason Wittmer, Mary Anne Patton, Hamish Crockett, Joanne Dellert, Klara Pickova, Leif Sawyer, Scott Johnson, Sufyan Hussain, Amy Tenderich, Brenda Weedman, Aaron Neinstein.
